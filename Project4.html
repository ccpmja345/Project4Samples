    //Step 1: Create an array of HTML colors
    var colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "white", "black", "purple", "orange", "brown", "grey"];

    //Step 2: Use a random number generator to pick one of the above colors.
    //Hint: This will generate a random number between 0 and 9:
    //i = Math.floor((Math.random() * 10));
    var i = Math.floor((Math.random() * 10));

    //Select the i-th element from the array in Step 1--this is the "Computer choice"
    alert(colors[i]);

    var userChoice = prompt("Choose one of the following colors\n red, blue, green, yellow, white, black, purple, orange, brown, gray", "");

    alert(userChoice);

    var computerChoice = prompt("Choose one of the following colors\n red, blue, green, yellow, white, black, purple, orange, brown, gray", "");

    alert(computerChoice);

    //Step 3: Prompt the user for a color choice (i.e. like in the assignment document
    //Step 4: Compare the "User choice" in Step 3 to the "Computer choice" from Step 2
    //Step 5: Create an IF statement:

      if (userChoice == computerChoice) {
          //"User choice" == "Computer choice"

      }
      //else
        //"User choice" is alphabetically < "Computer choice"
        //"User choice" is alphabetically > "Computer choice"

    else if (computerChoice == userChoice) {
           //"Computer choice" == "User choice"
      }
    //The user might have entered a color that doesn't exist in the array


    //Step 6: Alert the user of success or failure.  Change background color IF success.





    //    alert(colors[0]);
 //   alert(colors[4]);
  //  alert(colors[9]);
